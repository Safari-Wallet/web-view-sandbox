# web-view-sandbox

*This codebase is currently sloppy and repetitive. It was hastily shipped to iterate on some designs as quickly as possible.*

After cloning the repo, set up the sandbox environment (it's built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)):

```sh
cd test-dapp
npm i
```

Then run the sandbox on a local development server (port 3000 must be free):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then from an Xcode emulator, go to safari and visit http://localhost:3000

Watch the sandbox update in real time as you make changes to the `test-dapp` folder.
